This is my Lab 1 Assignment folder.

## Assignment:

Video App:

Using StoriesOnBoard, create a new, private, solo board which represents the User Story Map for an application for sharing videos on the internet, e.g. YouTube, TikTok, etc. Focus primarily on the user side of the application. Perform User Story Mapping to develop a map which captures the most necessary user stories for this application. In accomplishing this, you should have:

At least three epics in the backbone
At least six steps in the walking skeleton
At least 18 total tasks
All tasks need to have a name, status and time estimate, but the estimates need not be realistic
Edit the details for at least three tasks and try out different markdown features
At least 2 releases, including some unscheduled tasks
Experiment at least one extra feature, such as additional card colors, annotations or personas
The map does not need to exhaustively capture every feature of the application.

Hint: Try to think of different users of the application system, such as viewers, content developers, and administrators.

Running Assignment - Development Portfolio

Start a new (private for now) GitHub Repo which will be your portfolio for the course
Upon completing assignments, take screenshots and push them to the repo
You can investigate GitHub Pages if you want them to be totally on the web
Use GitHub best practices to create a high quality repo
You will add to this repo all semester!
For this lab, you only need to have a readme.md uploaded

## Submission:

Please submit the following

A screen capture of the overview of the User Story Map
Open the side bar to the left so that I can see your username
If this hides some of your tasks, you can do an additional screenshots so that I can see your name
Three screen captures of your three detailed tasks, one capture each
Include a readme.txt explaining which extra feature you tried
Include a screen capture of your GitHub repo so far, which should still be private
(This should be a total of 6-7 files)

Please submit to URCourses by the deadline.
