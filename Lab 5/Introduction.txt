This is my lab 5 Assignment folder.

## Assignment

Building a website for a Persona created for a Job Hunting Application:

Complete the Figma persona template provided (or make your own!)
Assue you are creating this Persona to aid in developing a Job Hunting website
Consider their goals, tasks, needs and frustrations of a user of a job hunting site
Create a new wordpress site in Local
(Optional) Install a different starter template than the one we looked at
This is optional as you may need to configure a lot of the template to work with your persona, and we won’t look at this in too much depth until next lab!
Create a home page which captures some elements of your persona’s personality, e.g. hobbies or interests
Create three new static pages, and link these to the home page
Use two or three site builder blocks on each page to convey a goal or task of the about the persona
e.g. If the persona wants a high paying job to give to charity, include some of their favourite charities
Make a blog page with three entries
In each one, comment on a specific need or pain point of the user.
e.g. if the user has had difficulty finding jobs that are available in the time they are free, have them write about it
It does not need to be lengthy.
You may use a text-generation site, e.g. ChatGPT to help with this
Make sure the blogs are all accessible from the main page, through either links in the menu, or using a blog post block
Document your site with screen-shots, one for the home page, one for each static page and one for eac blog page

## Submission

For this lab, please submit screenshots of your work, rather than your complete installation.
Please submit both the completed Persona template, as well as the screenshots of the website,
At the minimum, include screenshots of the home page, the three static pages, and the three blog pages
You may include all images in a single .zip file
