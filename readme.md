# Lab 1 Outline
In this lab, we learn how to stand out in the competitive software industry by using GitHub effectively. we get an overview of GitHub, learn how it works, and see examples of strong repositories. We also discuss using GitHub as a portfolio to showcase your work and attract potential employers. As part of the lab, we will be adding to our GitHub portfolio, which will be assessed in a live interview at the end of the semester. 

We also learn about version control using Git. Git helps you back up different versions of your source code and allows you to restore or switch between versions. We set up Git and a cloud service called GitHub, which can host our repositories remotely. We will be using VS Code, an open-source text editor, to synchronize our local files with GitHub repositories.

# Lab 2 Outline
In this lab, we are going to look at ways of documenting a high level view of a web application, including mapping out the pages that you need using SiteMaps, and mapping out the content needed and completed using a spreadsheet application. These activities broadly fall under the UX category of Information Architecture, which has roots in Library science (organizing and prioritizing content), and Cognitive Psychology (making it quick to learn, easy to understand and navigate).

# Lab 3 Outline
In this lab we will:
Get familiar with the UI and design tools available in Figma
Investigate how to create high fidelity wireframes
Do a complete example of a high fidelity (hi-fi) wireframe of a website
As we already saw an introduction to Figma in Lab 2, we will jump ahead to some slightly more advanced usage in this lab.

# Lab 4 Outline
We will now look at using the Figma Prototyping workflow to add some interactivity to our website mockups, which we can demonstrate using the Present function.

Download the starting files from URCourses, and open up travel-hyrule-starting.fig, a mobile tourism site for a fictional land.

We will work together through:

Setting a home page and previewing
Connecting the hamburger menu to each of the pages
Connecting the Weird Stuff page to their subpages
Add an automatic carousel to the first page
Add some light boxes to the locations page
Have a unique interaction on each of the strange
A slow auto-fade effect on the shrines page
A draggable gallery on the divine beasts page, with a subtle cover flow effect
A carousel with buttons on the towers page
Note, as this was adapted from XD, I am still using their terminology Artboard in places, but in Figma this is called a Frame.

# Lab 5 Outline
Wordpress is a free open source (FOSS) content management system (CMS) for the web, used historically to create blogs, but has since found wider use, including static and e-commerce sites. It can be extended with plugins and themes, either created by others or customized yourself.

Typically Wordpress is installed on a remote server running a LAMP stack: Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, though some components may be interchanged, such as Windows for Linux or NGINX for Apache. If you have already taken ENSE 353 you have created such a stack, where a completed wordpress installation could be deployed.

For this course we will use an application called “Local WP” to install a local wordpress development site, which can be used for single-user prototyping and testing on your local machine without a server. Historically, one would use a streamlined LAMP installation, such as XAMPP, which has some advantages and disadvantages over our approach. Local was developed by Flywheel, a web-hosting service, and has released this tool to help people learn, hoping you will later host your site with them, but there is no obligation to do so. Local encapsulates the server and database applications needed by Wordpress, allowing you to quickly start the needed services on demand.

# Lab 6 Outline
From a design perspective, Content management systems necessarily trade-off some power and performance in favour of ease of use. This means that, as a designer, you will be able to largely match the general design envisioned, but will likely not be able to perfectly replicate it out-of-the box without either installing third-party plugins, some of which are paid, or coding them yourself using a combination of CSS, JavaScript and PHP. As a software engineering student, this should not deter you from using the software. The ultimate goal is that you will be able to design a website which largely matches your envisioned idea, and still be easily transferable to a client, who will be able to further edit it and add content without extensive technical knowledge.

To achieve this goal, we will work today with templates and page builders to quickly get a site up and running and iterate towards our desired design.

We will attempt to implement several pages from the TRAVEL Hyrule site, which we looked at in Prototyping in Figma, in wordpress using Wordpress Blocks. We will necessarily observe some of the limitations of the software.

Set-up
Start from a fresh site with Local for this week’s lab
We will start our site from a template which will install dummy content
Reminder: In settings: Set title, tagline, and time zone
You will also want to set perma-links type to “post name”, which will make the URL subdirectory structure human-readable

# Lab 7 Outline
Time slots have been selected by random number generator
You only need to be in the lab or in zoom in your slot time
 If you are in zoom, you will need a microphone and webcam
 If you are joining by Zoom, find your name in the list below to see which room to join
You will have about 9 minutes to complete the interview
You will need to answer 3 questions using your GitHub portfolio as evidence
 Questions will vary from student to student, selected randomly from a pool of questions
 You will be marked based on:
 - Identifying People-Centred Design concepts and principles where appropriate
 - Application of those principles
 - Demonstrating them with evidence through your portfolio
