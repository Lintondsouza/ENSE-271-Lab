# Welcome to my ENSE 271 Repository

# Lab 1
In this lab, we learn how to stand out in the competitive software industry by using GitHub effectively. we get an overview of GitHub, learn how it works, and see examples of strong repositories. We also discuss using GitHub as a portfolio to showcase your work and attract potential employers. As part of the lab, we will be adding to our GitHub portfolio, which will be assessed in a live interview at the end of the semester. 

We also learn about version control using Git. Git helps you back up different versions of your source code and allows you to restore or switch between versions. We set up Git and a cloud service called GitHub, which can host our repositories remotely. We will be using VS Code, an open-source text editor, to synchronize our local files with GitHub repositories.
